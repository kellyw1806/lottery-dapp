# lottery-dapp

A lottery decentralized app with Ethereum, using a Solidity smart contract. Used the Sepolia testnet to deploy the contract, web3.js, node.js and React.Js for parts of the front-end. Capable of having a user connect their wallet (MetaMask wallet) to the site. It will display any previous lottery winners, the current lottery players with links to each individual EtherScan profile, and the total Ethereum pot. The admin (server-side only) can then randomly generate a winner that will automatically allow for a transaction to occur for the winner.
